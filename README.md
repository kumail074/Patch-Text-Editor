## Patch Text Editor
A simple, Vim-inspired text editor with basic features, built from scratch using C. This text editor offers a minimalist interface for users who prefer keyboard-based text editing, similar to Vim, but with fewer features.

## Features

- **Keyboard navigation**: Navigate through text using basic Vim-like keybindings.
- **Search functionality**: Find specific text within the file.
- **Save and exit**: Easily save your changes and exit the editor.

## Installation

```

## Limitations
This project is a basic implementation of a Vim-like text editor and does not yet support more advanced features like syntax highlighting, multi-file editing, or plugins. The goal of this project is to provide a minimalist, keyboard-centric text editor with simple functionality, similar to Vim.
